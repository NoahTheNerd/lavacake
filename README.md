## Introduction
Lavacake is a Hypixel API webserver that's built on [Bun](https://bun.sh/), making it *lightning-fast*! Lavacake also wraps parts of the API, removing most of the junk & doing the math for you!

## Installation
This installation guide is intended for Linux servers. There may be small differences or incompatibility issues for macOs and Windows.

First, install Bun using this command. Or check out [their website](https://bun.sh/)!
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Now, get the latest release from the releases tab or copy of the codebase through <kbd><> Code</kbd>.

Unzip it wherever, then open your command line. Navigate into the folder and run this commands to get all packages:
```bash
bun install
```

Create a new folder called `token.json`. Here you will paste your tokens! If you don't have an application token or developer token, they can be obtained at [the Hypixel developer portal](https://developer.hypixel.net/). These will then be pasted in their respective values. Set the active token to either `devToken` or `appToken` for which token to use.
```json
{
    "devToken":"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "appToken":"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "active":"devToken"
}
```

We recommend hosting it on a screen or tmux session. You can then type the following command to get it all running! 
The app will start on Port 9753

```bash
bun index.ts
```
